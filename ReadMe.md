# RaiBlocks NodeJS RPC Client

RaiBlocks RPC client written with NodeJS.
It produces JSON objects or strings as output, wrapped in
native promises.

All RPC calls are defined here:

## Getting Started

1. Install the npm package:

```bash
$ yarn add node-raiblocks-rpc
# or
$ npm install node-raiblocks-rpc --save
```

2. Require the RPC client into your project:

```js
const RaiClient = require('node-raiblocks-rpc');
const NODE_ADDRESS = 'http://[urltonode|iptonode]:port';

/**
 * decodeJSON is an optional boolean argument.
 * When set to true (default), the JSON string response is
 * parsed into a JSON object. Otherwise the string is returned.
 */
const client = new RaiClient(NODE_ADDRESS [, decodeJSON]);
```

3. Use methods attached to `client` to send RPC calls:

### Examples

Head to the [`examples.js`](examples.js) file for even more!

```js
const client = new RaiClient(NODE_ADDRESS [, decodeJSON]);

// Some methods do not require arguments:
client
  .block_count()
  .then(count => {
    console.log(count);
    /**
     * {
     *   "count": "1826834",
     *   "unchecked": "3385205"
     * }
     */
  })
  .catch(e => {
    // Deal with your errors here.
  });

// Some methods require arguments:
client
  .account_balance("xrb_mySuperAddress")
  .then(balance => {
    console.log(balance);
    /**
     * {
     *   "balance": "325586539664609129644855132177",
     *   "pending": "2309370929000000000000000000000000"
     * }
     */
  })
  .catch(e => {
    // Deal with your errors here.
  });
```

### Promise-wrapped responses

All method calls return native NodeJS promises. You need to use the
`then()` / `catch()` pattern shown above. If the call was succesful,
the data will be passed to `then()`, otherwise the error will be passed
to `catch()`.

### Methods Names

The method calls are the same as the original RPC actions defined
on the RaiBlocks wiki.
(See https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol)

Example1: on the RaiBlocks wiki `account_balance` is called with `account`.
For the NodeJS client, the method is `account_balance` and the argument is the account string.

### Arguments

The arguments to use for those methods are detailed in the inline documentation of
the `index.js`. There are the same as those mentioned in the Monero documentation:
https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol

### Returned value

If you havent specified any `decodeJSON` argument when you
instantiated `RaiClient`, by default the returned data will already be parsed
into a JSON object for you. Otherwise you will receive the original JSON string
returned by the RaiBlocks network.

## Testing

Testing is done with `mocha`, `chai` and `chai-as-promised` to test promises.

To run the tests:

```bash
$ yarn test
# or
$ npm run test
```

The tests are located in the `lib/tests.js` file. They perform actual API calls to the RaiBlocks network through a local node. In order to prevent the tests from failing because of a timeout, tests are run with a `timeout` option of 100s. Tests can still fail if the local node is too slow.

If you want to just run one set of test (i.e a `describe` block), for let's say the `account_balance()` function, you can do so with this command:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --grep [functionNameHere] --timeout 10000
```

For example, if you want to test `account_balance`:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --grep account_balance --timeout 10000
```

You can be even more specific by adding `only` to the individual tests. Example for `account_balance()`:

```
describe("RaiClient.account_balance()", done => {
  it.only("should retrieve account balance", () => {
    expect(client.account_balance(WALLET_ADDRESS))
      .to.eventually.contain('"balance"')
      .and.to.eventually.contain('"pending"')
      .notify(done);
  });
});
```

## Possible future features

* Caching of some responses
  * First with javascript objects
  * Then with some external db, like Redis or SQLLite
* Make the library Isomorphic, i.e work in web-browsers as well
* Make the method calls also support callbacks
* Setup automated testing with travis. Will need first to build a mock object for RaiBlocks to have deterministic tests

## Donations

I currently work on this project during my free-time, but also during my work-time. As I'm my own boss, I take work time to work on personnal projects that I really believes in. But during this time, I don't win any money. I'm not doing that for money.

Anyway, if you consider support me, you can pay me a pack of Monster's cans for moore productive coding, :D.

I accept donations in form of RaiBlocks, Monero, Bitcoin, Etherum & IntenseCoin. You can also Patreon me !
